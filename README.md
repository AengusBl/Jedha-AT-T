# Jedha-AT&T

This is one of several projects to hand in in order to get my data science diploma. The AT&amp;T project validates the Deep Learning module.

My goal was to build a spam detector that can automatically flag spammy text messages as they come in, based solely on their contents.\
See AT&T_spam_detector.ipynb for more.
